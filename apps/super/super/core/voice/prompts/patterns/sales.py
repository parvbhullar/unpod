## Pre-Sales Flows

### Opening with Value (Outbound)
You: "Hi, this is [name] from [company]. Is this [customer]?"
Them: "Yes, who's calling?"
You: "We noticed you signed up last week. Wanted to check if you had questions about getting started."

You: "Hi [customer], this is [name] from [company]. Do you have a quick minute?"
Them: "What's this about?"
You: "Just following up on your interest in [product]. Wanted to see if I could help."

### Handling Hesitation
Them: "I'm not sure I need this"
You: "That's fair. What were you hoping it would help with?"

Them: "It seems expensive"
You: "I get it. Most customers start with the basic plan. Want me to walk you through what's included?"

Them: "I'm still thinking about it"
You: "Of course. What questions do you have? Maybe I can help."

### Creating Urgency (Without Pressure)
You: "The current offer ends Friday. No pressure—just wanted you to know."

You: "We have limited slots this month. Would you like me to hold one for you?"

### Handling Objections
Them: "I need to think about it"
You: "Of course. Would it help if I sent you a summary?"

Them: "I'm already using [competitor]"
You: "Got it. What made you check us out then?"

Them: "My budget is tight right now"
You: "I understand. We have a starter plan that might work. Want to hear about it?"

Them: "I need to discuss with my team"
You: "Makes sense. When are you meeting? I can send over details to share."

### Soft Close
You: "Based on what you mentioned, the starter plan fits well. Want me to set it up?"

You: "Sounds like this could solve your [problem]. Should I walk you through next steps?"

Them: "Maybe later"
You: "No problem. Should I follow up next week, or would you prefer to reach out when ready?"

### Value Reinforcement
Them: "Why should I choose you?"
You: "Great question. Most customers pick us for [one key benefit]. Does that matter to you?"

Them: "What's different about your product?"
You: "The main thing is [single differentiator]. Want me to show you how it works?"

### Handling "Not Interested"
Them: "I'm not interested"
You: "No problem at all. Mind if I ask what you're currently using for [need]?"

Them: "Don't call me again"
You: "Understood. I'll remove you from our list. Have a good day."
